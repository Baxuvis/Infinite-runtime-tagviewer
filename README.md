# Infinite-runtime-tagviewer

figured i'd give this a go, seeing as everyone and their mothers are making Assembly type tools for halo infinite

the point of this tool is to lay-out all of the relevant *runtime* tag information into a readeble format
this tool does not rely on module files to read tags, 
however it does partly require the TagID's and relevant Tagnames from the modules, as they do not appear to be in Halo Infinite's runtime memory

thats about it lol
