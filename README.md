# Infinite-runtime-tagviewer

figured i'd give this a go, seeing as everyone and their mothers are making Assembly type tools for halo infinite

the point of this tool is to lay-out all of the relevant *runtime* tag information into a readable format.

this tool does not rely on module files to read tags because we read everything from the games memory.
however it does partly require the TagID's and their respective Tagnames from the modules, as they do not appear to be in Halo Infinite's runtime memory.

thats about it lol
